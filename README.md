## Overview
The TIMELESS E-shop is a responsive web-app built with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org), [React](https://react.dev) and written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), so it can be easily refactored or manteined. The entire application is managed by my [CMS](https://github.com/salvatorequagliariello/ecommerce-dashboard), which send data about products, categories and billboards to the website via API.

The styling of the website is based on [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and in addition to being fully responsive, there is a Light/Dark theme mode that automatically sets itself according to the preferences of the operating system on which it is displayed.

Once on the e-commerce it is possible to browse through the different collections or filter search results by material, strap material, or movement type.

It is then possible to click on a specific timepiece to see its history and features in more detail, admire its case, or simply to purchase it. The E-commerce shopping cart allows customers to "buy" the watches they choose, thanks to the integration with Stripe, which will fully simulate the purchase phase.
