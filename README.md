## Overview
The TIMELESS E-shop is a responsive web-app built with NextJS and written in TypeScript, so it can be easily refactored or manteined. The entire application is managed by my CMS, which send data about products, categories, and billboards to the site via API.

The styling of the site is based on TailwindCSS, and in addition to being fully responsive, there is a Light/Dark theme mode that automatically sets itself according to the preferences of the operating system on which it is displayed.

Once on the e-commerce it is possible to browse through the different collections or filter search results by material, strap material, or movement type.

It is then possible to click on a specific timepiece to see its history and features in more detail, admire its shape, or simply to purchase it. The E-commerce shopping cart allows customers to "buy" the watches they choose, thanks to the integration with Stripe, which will fully simulate the purchase phase.
